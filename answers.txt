Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: One would consider using GIT because it tracks modifications to files, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously while maintaining a complete history of all the changes made to the code base. Additionally you can revert to an earlier code version if you want to. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to healthcare to predict disease outbreaks and improve patient outcomes using machine learning models. For example, hospitals use predictive analytics to identify patients at risk of readmission and provide early interventions.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines branches by creating a new merge commit, preserving the history and showing branch divergence. Rebasing rewrites commit history by applying changes sequentially, resulting in a cleaner, linear timeline.
