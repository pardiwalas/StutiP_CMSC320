Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: One would consider using GIT because it tracks modifications to files, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously while maintaining a complete history of all the changes made to the code base. Additionally you can revert to an earlier code version if you want to.
